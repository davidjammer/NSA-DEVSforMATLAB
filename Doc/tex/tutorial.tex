NSA-DEVSforMatlab (\defi{ND4M}) is a modeling and simulation tool for
discrete-event based simulation. It is based on Matlab and combines the ease of
use of graphical tools like Simevents or Arena with the mathematical
preciseness of DEVS. For this purpose it uses the DEVS variant NSA-DEVS
\cite{nsadevsIntro}. It comes with a growing library of components that can be
used to build a model graphically using the Simulink editor. A new component
can be built either by combining existing components in a hierarchy of
subsystems (\defi{coupled model}) or by defining it directly as a Matlab class
that implements the NSA-DEVS formalism (\defi{atomic model}).

The first chapter describes the installation and a short test, using one of the
example models coming with ND4M. The following chapters will use simple
examples to show, how to build models graphically and how to create own atomic
models from scratch. Working knowledge of Matlab and the basics of the Simulink
editor are required, but no prior knowledge of DEVS or NSA-DEVS.

All models and scripts that are presented in the following, can be found in
ND4M's \cft{Example} directory. It is advisable to rebuild at least the first
model from scratch.

\infopar{ Additional information, especially about the inner workings of ND4M
  and the definitions of NSA-DEVS, is provided in paragraphs marked with a
  magnifying glass. They can be safely ignored in a first reading.  }


\chapter{Installation}

If you haven't done so already, download NSA-DEVSforMatlab from its Github
repository \url{https://github.com/davidjammer/NSA-DEVSforMATLAB} and unpack
it. You can rename it and/or move it to an
arbitrary directory. In the
following this directory will be called \cft{NSADEVSHOME}. Furthermore create a
directory for your own models, it will be called \cft{MYMODELS}. For
concreteness we will use the following structure
\begin{Verbatim}  
  NSADEVSHOME=/home/testi/nsa-devs/NSA-DEVS
  MYMODELS=/home/testi/nsa-devs/mymodels
\end{Verbatim}
Then, create a subdirectory \cft{tutorial} of \cft{MYMODELS}, which will
contain all tutorial examples. Now start Matlab and extend the path to include
the NSA-DEVS files:
\begin{Verbatim}  
  NSADEVSHOME="/home/testi/nsa-devs/NSA-DEVS";
  addpath(genpath(NSADEVSHOME+"/Modelbase"));
  addpath(genpath(NSADEVSHOME+"/Modelgenerator"));
  addpath(genpath(NSADEVSHOME+"/Simulator"));
  addpath(genpath(NSADEVSHOME+"/Utilities"));
\end{Verbatim}
For later sessions save these lines in your \cft{startup.m}.

Test the installation by running one of the example models: First copy the
paper examples directory into your directory \cft{MYMODELS}. Open the example
model \cft{compswitch.slx} with Simulink to see the structure of the compswitch
example. Finally, run the command \cft{runCompswitch}, which should generate
the plot shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig_1}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.37\columnwidth]{images/bild01.pdf}
\caption{Plot generated with \cft{runCompswitch}.}
\label{fig_1}
\end{figure}

 
\chapter{Building and running a simple model} \label{sec3}

The first example will show how to create a simple model using the NSA-DEVS
block library and how to run it. The example model adds two streams of incoming
values, it displays the incoming streams and the result. The complete Simulink
model is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig_2}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.34\columnwidth]{images/bild02.pdf}
\caption{Model \cft{tut01}.}
\label{fig_2}
\end{figure}

To build the model \cft{tut01}, open the Simulink Library Browser and locate
the NSA-DEVS library that contains a few sublibraries. In \cft{Sources} you
will find the source block \cft{am\_vectorgen} that generates given output
values at given times. Add two of them to the new model. The sublibrary
\cft{Math Operations} contains the block \cft{am\_add2} that adds two incoming
numbers. Add one to the model. Finally, add three blocks \cft{am\_toworkspace}
from \cft{Sinks}. They are output blocks that store time and value of incoming
events in a global output variable that can be accessed after the
simulation. Now connect all blocks according to Fig.\ \ref{fig_2}.

All blocks contain parameters, which can be accessed after a double-click on
the block. Change the parameter \cft{vector of output times} of the upper
generator to \cft{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]} and its parameter \cft{vector of output
  values} to \cft{[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]}. Similarly, the lower generator gets the
values \cft{[1.3, 2.3, 3, 4, 4.6]} for the output times and \cft{[1, 2, 1, 3,
    1]} for its output values. The output blocks need different names for their
corresponding output variables. Set the parameter \cft{varname} to \cft{"in1"}
and \cft{"in2"} for the upper and lower blocks and to \cft{"out1"} for the
block that is connected to the output of the adder. This completes the model
\cft{tut01}.

\infopar{
If you look inside the block \cft{am\_add2} -- e.\ g.\ by clicking at the arrow
on the icon --, you'll find that it only contains input and output ports
without any functionality. The NSA-DEVS Simulink library contains only the
interface of a block. Besides its name and the number and names of the ports,
this includes the parameters with their default values, the icon and the
documentation. This information is stored in the block mask. The actual
definition of a block is provided by a Matlab file in the modelbase. For the
\cft{am\_add2} component, this is the file \cft{am\_add2.m} in
\cft{NSADEVSHOME/Modelbase/MathOperations}.
}

To run the model, create the simple Matlab file \cft{runTut01.m} shown in
Listing \ref{lst1}. Line 6 runs the model generator, which translates the
Simulink model into a set of Matlab files that describe the top-level model and
additional coupled models, if necessary. Line 7 starts the simulator, which
runs the model for the simulation time given in \cft{tEnd}, cleans up
intermediate files and returns all outputs in the variable \cft{out}. Finally,
line 8 calls the plot function, which displays the results.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Run script for example model \cft{tut01}.},captionpos=b,label=lst1]
function runTut01
% makes and runs the model and plots the results
model = "tut01";
tEnd = 6;

model_generator(model);
out = model_simulator(model, tEnd);
plotResults01(out, tEnd)
end
\end{lstlisting}

While the run script can be used similarly for all models, the plot function
has of course to be adapted to the concrete model and the needs of the
modeller. Listing \ref{lst2} presents a simple example that produces the output
shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig_3}. It uses the output data in the variable \cft{out},
which is a structure that contains a field for each \cft{am\_toworkspace}
block, using the field name given as parameter in the block (cf. lines 16, 23,
30). Each block returns its data again as a structure containing a field
\cft{t} with the vector of output times and a field \cft{y} with the output
values.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Plot function for example model \cft{tut01}.},captionpos=b,label=lst2]
function plotResults01(out, tEnd)
width = 450;
height = 600;
screenSize = get(0, "ScreenSize");
figureName = "tut01";

% open new figure only if necessary
hFig = findobj("Type", "figure", "Name", figureName);
if isempty(hFig)
  figure("name", figureName, "NumberTitle", "off", "Position", ...
      [screenSize(3)-width, screenSize(4)-height, width, height]);
end

tiledlayout("vertical")
nexttile
stem(out.in1.t, out.in1.y);
grid("on");
xlim([0, tEnd])
title("in_1");
xlabel("t")

nexttile
stem(out.in2.t, out.in2.y);
grid("on");
xlim([0, tEnd])
title("in_2");
xlabel("t")

nexttile
stem(out.out1.t, out.out1.y);
grid("on");
xlim([0, tEnd])
title("out_1");
xlabel("t")
end
\end{lstlisting}

Though the model looks like a simple Simulink model, this similarity is
misleading: Due to the discrete-event structure applied here, outputs don't
have values at all times, but only at those instants, when an event occurs.
Therefore the add block can't rely on simultaneous input values at both of its
inputs, but has to store incoming values, using initial values of $0$. The stem
plot chosen for Fig.\ \ref{fig_3} emphasizes this behaviour and should make the
results comprehensible.

\infopar{
  In case you wonder, what is going on after $t = 5$: The \cft{am\_vectorgen}
  repeats the time and output values cyclically, which creates an input at $t =
  5 + 1$ for $in_1$ and at $t = 4.6 + 1.3$ for $in_2$. To suppress such
  repetitions, simply add a final very large time at the end of the output
  times vector and an arbitrary corresponding output value.

  More information about the model generator and the semantics of a
  Simulink-like model in a discrete-event based environment can be found in
  \cite{nsaLargedemo}. The exact description of the simulator is a fundamental
  part of a DEVS formulation. The NSA-DEVS simulator used here is explained in
  detail in \cite{nsaSimulator2}.
}


\chapter{Working with Queues and Servers}

An important application of discrete-event simulation is the modeling of
queue-server systems, where people, goods or information are transported
through the system. Usually, they are modelled as abstract entities, which
carry additional information (\defi{attributes}). The example model will use
simple integer numbers (\defi{id's}) to represent them.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.42\columnwidth]{images/bild04.pdf}
\caption{Model \cft{tut02}.}
\label{fig_4}
\end{figure}

Fig.\ \ref{fig_4} shows the basic queue-server model \cft{tut02}. It starts
with a simple generator that outputs events with increasing integer values in
fixed time intervals (\cft{am\_generator}). They reach a queue
(\cft{am\_queue}), where they wait, until the server (\cft{am\_expserver}) is
ready for them. After a random, exponentially distributed service time they
leave the server and proceed to the terminator (\cft{am\_terminator}), where
they leave the system. Three output blocks \cft{am\_toworkspace} collect the
output values of the generator, the queue and the server. The parameter
\cft{mean service time} of the server is set to $0.9$. As always, the output
blocks have different and meaningful names for their \cft{varname}. And just to
get nicer looking plots, the parameter \cft{id of the first entity} of the
generator is set to $1$.

\infopar{ The names of blocks in Simulink can be chosen arbitrarily. In ND4M
  they have to be proper variable names, therefore they can't contain spaces or
  other special characters.  }

An unusual feature is the line running back from the server to the queue. It is
needed here due to the semantics of the queue, which outputs entities unless it
is blocked. Its blocking status is given by an additional input, which is
connected to the output \cft{working} of the server. It is true, when the
server is busy.

\infopar{ The exact timing of the signaling loop and the internal behaviour of
  server and queue are of paramount importance here! Unfortunately, in the
  usual modeling approach all time delays are zero, the correponding events are
  concurrent and their exact order is often hard to control. NSA-DEVS uses a
  different concept, based on infinitesimal delays \cite{nsadevsIntro,
    nsaSimulator2}: All inputs and all ``immediate'' state changes are delayed,
  where the delays are defined as block parameters of the form $a + b\,\epsi$
  with real values $a, b$ and an infinitesimally small $\epsi$. In ND4M such
  values are represented by Matlab vectors \cft{[a,b]}. These parameters are
  predefined in the library, they are collected in a tab of \cft{Advanced}
  parameters and generally have the value \cft{[0,1]} $\corresponds\; \epsi$.
  But to make the queue-server pair work, the queue parameter \cft{delay time
    of the queuingFree state} has the default value \cft{[0,2]}. In special
  cases it may be necessary to fine-tune such a parameter to make a model work
  in the expected way \cite{nsaLargedemo}. Exact mathematical definitions and a
  careful analysis of the queue-server model can be found in
  \cite{nsaExamples}.  }

The run function sets the \cft{seed} parameter of the simulator, which
guarantees a reproducible outcome of the simulation. Otherweise, one gets a
different output with each run. The value of the seed has been chosen carefully
to create results that can be easily analyzed (cf.\ Fig.\ \ref{fig_5}): Except
for a short period after $t = 3$, the queue is empty before $t = 6$ and after
$t = 10$.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\includegraphics[width=0.33\columnwidth]{images/bild05.pdf}
\caption{Output plot of Model \cft{tut02}.}
\label{fig_5}
\end{figure}


\chapter{Using Entities with Attributes}

Many applications use entities with attributes instead of simple numbers. ND4M
contains several components for this purpose \cite{nsaInvitation}. In the next
example, they are put to good use to add statistical output to the simple
queue-server model \cft{tut02}.

Four atomics are included in the library to handle entity attributes:
\cft{am\_adddata} adds a set of fields denoting new attributes to each incoming
entity. If the input is not already an entity (i. e. of type \cft{struct}), an
entity is created with an additional attribute that stores the input
value. \cft{am\_writedata} changes the value of an entity attribute using
values from other attributes. The changing function is defined as a string
parameter describing an arbitrary Matlab command. \cft{am\_readdata} outputs
the value of an attribute from the input entity and \cft{am\_deletedata}
deletes a set of attributes.

The model \cft{tut03} extends the queue-server model by adding the following
statistical outputs:
\begin{itemize}
\item the current queue length,
\item the current utilization of the server,
\item the total throughput time of the entities.
\end{itemize}
The first value is given explicitely as an output of the queue. For the second
value, the number \cft{n} of entities in the server ($0$ or $1$) is sent to the
component \cft{am\_utilization}, which computes the mean value over time of its
input. The throughput time of an entity is the sum of its waiting time in the
queue and the processing time in the server. A common way to compute it is to
store the creation time of an entity in an attribute and subtract this value
from the current time, when the entity leaves the server.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.81\columnwidth]{images/bild06.pdf}
\caption{Model \cft{tut03}.}
\label{fig_6}
\end{figure}

This idea is implemented in the model (cf.\ Fig.\ \ref{fig_6}) in the following
way: The \cft{am\_adddata} component converts the incoming value into an entity
with a field \cft{id} to store the incoming number and a field \cft{startTime}
with the initial value $0$. The \cft{am\_writedata} component then computes the
current simulation time using the auxiliary function \cft{get\_time} and stores
it in the \cft{startTime} attribute. More explicitely, its parameter
\cft{changing function}, which contains a Matlab command that always stores its
result in a variable named \cft{out}, has the value \cft{"out = get\_time();"}
and the \cft{output field name} is \cft{"startTime"}. After the entity has left
the server, another \cft{am\_writedata} component changes \cft{"startTime"}
using the command \cft{"out = get\_time() - in(1);"} as its \cft{changing
  function}. The variable \cft{in(1)} refers to the first attribute name given
in the parameter \cft{input field names}, which could be a vector of attributes
to use in the computation. Finally the \cft{am\_readdata} outputs the current
value of the \cft{"startTime"} attribute.

The final simulation results are shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig_7}. The corresponding
plot function has two new features: Firstly, one can't use \cft{out.srvOut.y}
to reference the output vector of the server, because \cft{y} itself is now a
vector of \cft{struct} variables. The vector of its \cft{id} fields has to be
specified as \cft{[out.srvOut.y.id]}. The complete plot statement therefore is
\begin{verbatim}
  stem(out.srvOut.t,[out.srvOut.y.id]);
\end{verbatim}
Secondly, though the queue length and server utilization are specified by
events at special time instants, they are usually displayed using stair plots
with
\begin{verbatim}
  stairs(out.qLen.t,out.qLen.y);
\end{verbatim}
This corresponds to the idea, that these values stay constant between events,
which is true exactly for the queue length, but only approximately for the
server utilization.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\includegraphics[width=0.50\columnwidth]{images/bild07.pdf}
\caption{Output plot of Model \cft{tut03}.}
\label{fig_7}
\end{figure}


\chapter{Creating Coupled Components} \label{sec6}

Often, entities enter a system not with constant time differences, but in a
stochastical manner. An important arrival process is the Poisson process, where
the interarrival times are exponentially distributed. Though such a generator
is -- at the moment of writing -- not included in the block library, it can be
created easily, as is shown in the next example \cft{tut04a}
(cf.\ Fig.\ \ref{fig_8}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.99\columnwidth]{images/bild08.pdf}
\caption{Model \cft{tut04a}.}
\label{fig_8}
\end{figure}

The exponential generator consists of four components: An \cft{am\_generator}
(named \cft{initialEvent}) creates a single output $1$ at time $t = 0$, which
is sent through an \cft{am\_collect2} block to a server with mean service time
$t_S = 1.1$. It is delayed by the \cft{am\_expserver} and leaves the
generator. A copy is routed through an \cft{am\_bias} block, which increments
its value, and sent back to the server resulting in a permanent output stream.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.50\columnwidth]{images/bild09.pdf}
\caption{Output plot of Model \cft{tut04a}.}
\label{fig_9}
\end{figure}

Fig.\ \ref{fig_9} displays the simulation results, which show the typical
lumpiness of an exponential distribution. To get an impression of the large
variability of the results, one should try different values of the seed
parameter. Statistical variables such as the mean queue length have a large
standard deviation here, therefore one needs a lot of runs (with different
seeds) to get good approximations.

In Simulink, the four components of the exponential generator can be combined
in a subsystem. To make the model generator work, this subsystem needs a
mask. In the simplest case (\cft{tut04b}), it just defines the type of the
component in the documentation. Of course, a proper mask contains an icon and a
documentation and defines some block parameters. The corresponding model
\cft{tut04c} is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig_10}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\columnwidth]{images/bild10.pdf}
\caption{Model \cft{tut04c}.}
\label{fig_10}
\end{figure}

\infopar{ The model generator creates a Matlab description of the main model --
  and recursively of all subsystems contained in the model -- using its
  Simulink description. To have a look at these files, one can call the model
  simulator with \cft{out = model\_simulator(model, tEnd, "clearFlag", false)},
  which stops it from removing them after the simulation. One now finds the
  directory \cft{tut04c} containing the main Matlab file
  \cft{build\_tut04c}. It consists of five sections:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item create atomics,
  \item add atomics to simulators,
  \item create coupled models,
  \item add simulators and models to coordinator,
  \item add couplings.
  \end{itemize}
  This is the proper description of the coupled model and could have been
  created manually instead of its Simulink version. The mentioned coordinator
  and simulators are parts of the model simulator. After use, e.\ g.\ for
  debugging purposes, the directory can be safely deleted, since it will be
  reconstructed from the Simulink model at the next run.
}


\chapter{Creating a Simple Atomic Component} \label{sec7}

To create an atomic component from scratch, one has to write a corresponding
class file that implements the definition of an NSA-DEVS atomic model
\cite{nsaSimulator2}. A simple example \cft{am\_max2} that computes the maximal
value of its two inputs will illustrate the basic procedure.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.40\columnwidth]{images/bild11.pdf}
\caption{Basic structure of an NSA-DEVS atomic model.}
\label{fig_11}
\end{figure}

The NSA-DEVS specification of an atomic model consists of a set of input ports
$X$ and output ports $Y$, a set of internal states $S$, an input delay time
$\tau$, a function $ta(s)$ that returns the lifetime of a state $s$, an output
function $\lambda$ and a transition function $\delta$ that computes the next
state (cf.\ Fig.\ \ref{fig_11}). A state change happens, when the lifetime of
the current state is over or when an input event arrives.

Listing \ref{lst3} shows a (slightly simplified version of) the class
definition of \cft{am\_max2}. As has been noted for the \cft{am\_add2}
component in section \ref{sec3}, the \cft{am\_max2} component has to store
incoming values internally. For this purpose, the \cft{properties} section in
the class definition contains the two fields \cft{u1} and \cft{u2} (lines
5f). The three additional properties in lines 7--9 are mandatory for ND4M
atomics: \cft{name} stores the name of the component, usually defined in the
Simulink description of the coupled model containing this atomic, \cft{tau} is
the input delay time, usually set to \cft{[0,1]}, and \cft{debug} is a debug
flag, usually set to \cft{false}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Simplified code of \cft{am\_max2.m}.},captionpos=b,label=lst3]

      obj.u2 = -Inf;
      obj.name = name;
      obj.debug = debug;
      obj.tau = tau;
    end

    function delta(obj,e,x)
      if isfield(x, "in1")
        obj.u1 = x.in1;
      end
      if isfield(x, "in2")
        obj.u2 = x.in2;
      end
    end

    function y = lambda(obj,e,x)
      s1 = obj.u1;
      s2 = obj.u2;
      if isfield(x, "in1")
        s1 = x.in1;
      end
      if isfield(x, "in2")
        s2 = x.in2;
      end
      y.out = max(s1, s2);
    end

    function t = ta(obj)
      t = [inf, 0];
    end
  end
end
\end{lstlisting}

The \cft{methods} section begins with the constructor function (lines
13--19). Its parameter list always starts with a variable for \cft{name} and
generally ends with variables for \cft{tau} and \cft{debug}. In between there
can be additional external parameters of the component. The constructor defines
meaningful initial values for all internal state variables. For an input of the
maximum function, this is \cft{-Inf} as the neutral element of the max
operation. The lifetime function \cft{ta} (lines 42--44) simply returns the
value \cft{[Inf, 0]} (\defi{infinity}), since the state of the component is
changed only by incoming events. The \cft{delta} function (lines 21--28) only
stores any incoming values, while the \cft{lambda} function (lines 30--40)
outputs the maximum of the input values, using stored values, where no current
input is available.

Comparing this listing to the actual file \cft{am\_max2.m} in the tutorial
examples, one finds three differences:
\begin{itemize}
\item A state variable \cft{s}, which is used to store a \defi{macroscopic}
  state (\defi{phase}) describing the behaviour of a complex component
  (cf. section \ref{sec9}). In this simple example it has the fixed value

To add this new atomic to a Simulink block library, one starts by creating a
local Simulink library and adding a subsystem that only contains the input and
output ports (Fig.\ \ref{fig_12}), using the names given in the class
(cf.\ lines 31f, 39). The library block has the same name as the atomic and a
mask with an icon, its documentation and parameters. The parameters are grouped
in two tabs: \cft{General} for the usual parameters (empty in the current
example) and \cft{Advanced} for special values such as \cft{tau} and
\cft{debug}.

To test the component, one creates a small model such as \cft{tut05}
(Fig.\ \ref{fig_13}). Fig.\ \ref{fig_14} displays the simulation results, if
everything is correct. If not: Proceed to section \ref{sec8}.

\chapter{Debugging} \label{sec8}

The last two sections will dive deeper into the internals of ND4M modeling and
simulation. Therefore it is advisable to proceed further only after one has
read the \defi{internal information} parts of the previous sections.

Discrete-event models can easily contain very hard to find errors. To support
the debugging process, ND4M contains several debugging options at different
levels of the simulation process, which will be briefly explained and then
applied to solve a problem with the test model \cft{tut06}.

On the highest level, one can use two additional options of the model
simulator:
\begin{verbatim}
  out = model_simulator(model, tEnd, "clearFlag", false, "displayFlag", false);
\end{verbatim}
If the \cft{clearFlag} is set to \cft{false}, the intermediate Matlab files
created by the model generator for coupled models are not deleted after use
(cf.\ section \ref{sec6}). This is helpful to identify errors in the Simulink
models. If the \cft{displayFlag} is set to \cft{true}, the simulator outputs
time stamps on the fine-grained infinitesimal level during simulation. This can
be useful, if the simulator is caught in a loop, or together with block-level
debugging.

On the block level, every atomic component has (or should have!) a debug flag
as parameter. It can be set to \cft{true} in the Simulink model for each
component individually, giving fine grained control to prevent a flood of debug
messages.  Armed components should output their input and output values and all
state changes during the simulation run. This is best used together with
\cft{displayFlag = true} to get corresponding time stamps.

Two different methods are especially useful for detecting problems with the
order of concurrent events: The model simulator defines a global variable
\cft{mu}, which is usually set to $0$. If it is larger, it will be used as a
small time interval instead of the inifinitesimal $\epsi$. This makes the order
of formerly concurrent events directly visible in plots. On the other hand, it
could lead to a different behaviour of a model, therefore it has to be used
with extra care. A non-intrusive way to see concurrent events is to change the
value of the \cft{tau} parameter of an \cft{am\_toWorkspace} atomic. By
default, it is set to \cft{[0,5]}, which usually is larger than the
infinitesimal time delays appearing at the block. In this case it gets only the
last event of an infinitesimal series of events. Changing \cft{tau} to a value
smaller than the appearing delays (usually \cft{[0,0.5]} should work), the
block registers all incoming events, which will be plotted at the same time.

This feature of the \cft{am\_toWorkspace} atomic is the consequence of the
fundamental behaviour of the model simulator: When an event arrives at an input
during the delay time of a previous input event at the same port, the previous
event will be overwritten completely and the delay time starts afresh. 
  
Finally, the model simulator provides the global variable \cft{DEBUGLEVEL}. If
it is set to $1$, all internal simulator messages will be collected and
displayed graphically (cf. \cite{nsaSimulator2}) utilizing the Sequence Diagram
tool available from Matlab File Exchange. This feature is mainly used to debug
the simulator itself, but it might be useful for very weird timing problems in
a model -- for \emph{small} models! \\

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.88\columnwidth]{images/bild15.pdf}
\caption{Model \cft{tut06a}.}
\label{fig_15}
\end{figure}

The tutorial example \cft{tut06} mainly consists of a standard queue-server
model with fixed intergeneration and service times, both equal to $1$
(Fig.\ \ref{fig_15}). But now the service process, actually a manufacturing
process, is assumed to be imperfect: About 50\% of the parts have to be
reworked. Therefore the entities have a new attribute \cft{outPort}, which is
set randomly to $1$ or $2$ by \cft{am\_writedata}. The following
\cft{am\_distribute2} component uses this attribute to decide, where to route
an entity. The imperfect entities are routed back to the queue through an
\cft{am\_collect2} atomic. We define the behaviour of the model precisely by
requiring that parts to be reworked should take precedence, whenever a new and
a processed part arrive at the collector simultaneously.

The output of the simulation is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig_16}. While the basic
behaviour is ok -- all parts are generated correctly and finally leave the
system --, it is hard to see, what is going on in detail: The plot \cft{Queue
  in} never shows parts $5$ and $6$ and seems to be in conflict with the
\cft{Queue out} plot.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.48\columnwidth]{images/bild16.pdf}
\caption{Output plot of Model \cft{tut06a}.}
\label{fig_16}
\end{figure}

Obviously, \cft{Queue in} is missing some events. Since the input of the
queue is the only port, where entities can arrive simultaneously, the behaviour
is becoming more transparent, when setting the \cft{tau} parameter of the
corresponding \cft{am\_toWorkspace} block to \cft{[0,0.5]}. The new result is
displayed in Fig.\ \ref{fig_17}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.24\columnwidth]{images/bild17.pdf}
\caption{ \cft{Queue in} plot of Model \cft{tut06b}.}
\label{fig_17}
\end{figure}

Now everything seems to be clear: At $t = 2$ both the processed part $1$ and
the new part $2$ concurrently arrive at the input of the queue, and part $2$
appears at the output -- in violation of our precedence rule. A fix seems to be
easy: To delay the incoming new part, the \cft{tau} parameter of
\cft{am\_adddata} is enlarged to \cft{[0,2]}. A quick run shows that -- against
our expectation -- the simulation results haven't changed! And increasing
\cft{tau} to \cft{[0,3]} doesn't change anything either. Instead of further
fiddling around with parameters, we set the \cft{debug} flag of
\cft{am\_collect2} and set \cft{displayFlag = true} to see precisely, what is
going on. A simulation run (with the original \cft{tau} value of
\cft{am\_adddata}) produces a lot of output in the command window. To precisely
understand, what is going, we first have a look at the behaviour, when only a
new part arrives: 
\newpage
\begin{verbatim}
-----------------------------------------------
t: 1.00 + 2.00 ε
am_collect2 lambda
  in: in1=[ id:1.000 outPort:0.000 ] , out: 
am_collect2 entering delta
  phase=idle q=[] 
am_collect2 leaving delta
  phase=go q=[ id:1.000 outPort:0.000 ]
-----------------------------------------------
t: 1.00 + 4.00 ε

  in: , out: [ id:1.000 outPort:0.000 ]
am_collect2 entering delta
  phase=go q=[ id:1.000 outPort:0.000 ]
am_collect2 leaving delta
  phase=idle q=[] 
-----------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}

Due to the delay from the \cft{am\_adddata} component, part $1$ arrives at the
collector at $t = 1 + \epsi$, where it is delayed by another $\epsi$. It is not
output immediately, but stored in the internal queue \cft{q} and the phase
changes from \cft{idle} to \cft{go}. After a delay of $\tau_D = 2\epsi$
(defined as parameter in \cft{am\_collect2}) the part is sent to the \cft{out}
port, the internal queue is emptied and the phase returns to \cft{idle}. Let's
now proceed to $t = 2$, when the next part arrives.


\begin{verbatim}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
t: 2.00 + 2.00 ε
am_collect2 lambda
  in: in1=[ id:2.000 outPort:0.000 ] , out:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  in: , out: [ id:2.000 outPort:0.000 ]
am_collect2 entering delta
  phase=go q=[ id:2.000 outPort:0.000 , id:1.000 outPort:2.000 ]
am_collect2 leaving delta
  phase=go q=[ id:1.000 outPort:2.000 ]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
t: 2.00 + 7.00 ε

  in: , out: [ id:1.000 outPort:2.000 ]

  phase=idle q=[] 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}

Part $2$ arrives at the first port of the collector at $t = 2 + \epsi$
(before the internal delay), while part $1$ has been sent back and arrives
at the other port of the collector at $t = 2 + 2\epsi$. This is during (ok, at
the end of) the waiting time from the first input port, therefore the call of
the $\delta$-function is delayed. At $t = 2 + 3\epsi$, both input entities are
stored in \cft{q} and the phase is changed to \cft{go}. This change takes
$2\epsi$, then part $2$ is sent to the \cft{out} port, while the queue is
shortened accordingly. Again $2\epsi$ later part $1$ is output, the queue
emptied and the block returns to phase \cft{idle}.

This analysis makes clear, why a delay of the incoming part of \cft{tau =
  [0,2]} from \cft{am\_adddata} doesn't help: In this case part $1$ and $2$
arrive at the same time $2 + 2\epsi$ at the collector. But even \cft{tau =
  [0,3]} doesn't change the output order: Now part $2$ arrives during the
waiting time of the incoming part $1$, the $\delta$ call is delayed and
everything proceeds as before. But a larger delay, e.\ g.\ \cft{tau = [0,4]}
does the trick: The debug output shows that the collector is already in the
\cft{go} phase, when part $2$ arrives. Therefore, part $1$ is output and part
$2$ is stored in \cft{q} to be output $2\epsi$ later, at last coming behind
part $1$ in the queue component.  The output plot (Fig.\ \ref{fig_18}) shows
the new behaviour with the required ordering of events.

\chapter{Creating a Complex Atomic Component} \label{sec9}

The behaviour of many atomic components is much more complex than the simple
component built in section \ref{sec7}. A very typical example is the queue,
which can best be described by introducing several phases that combine states
with a similar behaviour. The implementation of the basic atomic
\cft{am\_queue} will be described in some detail, before it is extended to
\cft{am\_finiteQueue}, a queue with a finite capacity. More background
information, especially about the concrete mathematical formulation, can be
found in \cite{nsaExamples}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.76\columnwidth]{images/bild21.pdf}
\caption{State diagram of \cft{am\_queue}.}
\label{fig_21}
\end{figure}

The behaviour of the queue can be described using four phases according to the
blocking status and the size of the queue length (empty or not). It is
visualized using an NSA-DEVS diagram (cf.\ Fig.\ \ref{fig_21}) as described in
\cite{nsaDiagram}. All phases except \emph{QueueingFree} are passive states,
i.\ e.\ they have infinite lifetime and change only, when inputs arrive. The
queue always starts in the phase \emph{EmptyFree}, it changes to
\emph{EmptyBlocked}, when the input port \cft{bl} receives a value $1$, and to
\emph{QueuingFree}, when an entity arrives at input \cft{in}.  The most
interesting phase is \emph{QueuingFree} being the only one, where the queue
outputs entities. It is a transitory state, which means in NSA-DEVS that it has
an infinitesimal delay time $\tau_D$. Fig.\ \ref{fig_21} is simplified for
clarity, it doesn't show outputs at \cft{nq} or state transitions, when
both inputs receive events simultaneously. A complete version is shown in
\cite{nsaDiagram}.

The implementation of \cft{am\_queue} closely follows the diagram: The lifetime
function \cft{ta} and the output function $\lambda$ can be read off easily, the
more complex state change function $\delta$ is structured using the phases at
the outer level and the input value at an inner level:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={$\delta$ function of \cft{am\_queue.m}.},captionpos=b,label=lst4]
    function delta(obj,e,x)
      [bl, in] = getInput(obj, x);
      switch obj.s
        case "emptyFree"
          if ~isempty(bl) && bl == "1" && isempty(in)
            obj.s = "emptyBlocked";
          elseif ~isempty(bl) && bl == "1" && ~isempty(in)
            obj.s = "queuingBlocked";
            obj.q = [obj.q, in];
          elseif ~isempty(in)
            obj.s = "queuingFree";
            obj.q = [obj.q, in];
          else  % no entities, bl status remains
          end
        case "emptyBlocked"
          if ~isempty(bl) && bl == "0" && isempty(in)
            obj.s = "emptyFree";
          elseif ~isempty(bl) && bl == "0" && ~isempty(in)
            obj.s = "queuingFree";
            obj.q = [obj.q, in];
          elseif ~isempty(in)
            obj.s = "queuingBlocked";
            obj.q = [obj.q, in];
          else % no entities, bl status remains
          end
        case "queuingFree"
          if isempty(x)     % internal event
            if (isscalar(obj.q))
              obj.s = "emptyFree";
            else
              obj.s = "queuingFree";
            end
            obj.q = obj.q(2:end);
          else             % confluent event
            if ~isempty(bl) && bl == "1"
              % blocking has precedence, no entity leaves!
              obj.s = "queuingBlocked";
              obj.q = [obj.q, in];
            else
              obj.q = [obj.q(2:end), in];
              if isempty(obj.q)
                obj.s = "emptyFree";
              else
                obj.s = "queuingFree";
              end
            end
          end
        case "queuingBlocked"
          obj.q = [obj.q, in];
          if isequal(bl, "0")
            obj.s = "queuingFree";
          end
      end
    end
\end{lstlisting}

It is now easy to include a finite capacity: First one introduces the capacity
as a new system parameter and state variable and adds a new output
\cft{isFull}. Next, the $\lambda$-function is extended to send the correct
value to \cft{isFull}. Finally, the $\delta$-function checks, whether there is
still room for an incoming entity. If not, the entity is lost and a warning
displayed. A typical code snippet looks like this:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Part of the $\delta$ function of \cft{am\_finiteQueue.m}.},captionpos=b,label=lst5]
        case "queuingBlocked"
          if ~isempty(in)
            if length(obj.q) < obj.capacity
              obj.q = [obj.q, in];
            else
              fprintf("%s, in delta, phase %s - dropping input %s\n", ...
                obj.name, obj.s, getDescription(x.in))           
            end
          end
\end{lstlisting}
One problem with the warning message is the wide range of possible types of
income entities: It could be a simple number, a struct variable or even
something different. The auxiliary function \cft{getDescription} tries hard to
create a string description of its argument.

The example model \cft{tut07} shows the new component in action. Since the loss
of entities usually is not an option for a meaningful model -- as it isn't in
reality! --, one has to make sure that this case doesn't happen. A simple
procedure is to stop the generator process as soon as the queue has reached its
capacity (cf.\ Fig.\ \ref{fig_19}).

\caption{Model \cft{tut07}.}
\label{fig_19}
\end{figure}

The output plot in Fig.\ \ref{fig_20} shows that this approach works: The
\cft{isFull} signal stops the \cft{am\_enabledGenerator}, until the queue has
room for another entity.
